# Connect 4 Game - Assignment 2 Software Development

## Overview

This is an implementation of the Connect 4 Game as part of the UH Software
Development course.

This game uses a textual user interface, adopting a command-line interaction
interface for gameplay.

## Features

* Textual user interface: This game is playable without a graphical user
interface of any kind. You can run it on an old 90s terminal if you want.
* Player vs Player: The game adopts a multiplayer paradigm for its gameplay,
switching between two players every turn.
* Customisable Board: The board size can be set to any size, between 8x6 and
18x12.

## System Requirements

* Python 3.x: The game is written using Python 3.10 in mind, so you should grab
the latest version of Python 3.
* A terminal of some kind: Any computer has one of these. If you can't find it,
look for "Command Prompt" or "Terminal" in your OS search.

## Downloading

You need Git installed on your system.

**Please be aware Git is not the same as GitHub.** Git is the version control
software; GitHub is the Microsoft-owned online platform that just USES Git.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/MeenaSoftwareDevelopment/connect-4
cd connect-4/connect-4
```

## Running

On Windows, run `python main.py`. On *nix, run `python3 main.py`.

After running the appropriate command, you'll see the Connect 4 game interface
in your terminal. Follow the on-screen instructions to make your moves and enjoy
the game!
